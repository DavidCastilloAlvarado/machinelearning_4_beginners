# PERCEPTRÃ“N
In this little work we create a perceptron model who can classify 
if you are able for go to a party, I know is straugforward, 
but this is a spotlight for the beginners, using this model 
they can create his own model or undestrand how a neural-network works.

X_input = [X1, X2]
Y_output = {-1,1}
